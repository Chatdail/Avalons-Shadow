	"heist_hwu_brief":"We've recieved information that Avalon has data that could be potentially dangerous to our operation. They like to keep their eyes on things, so they've set up in a safehouse close by. Infiltrate the safehouse and find those documents, we can't afford for this intel to leak. \n\nI'd prefer if you did this quiet, no strings attached and all that. But I'm a sucker for violence, so if you do have to make a mess of things at least make it entertaining. \n\nWe're not sure what information they have, where it's at, or how to access it... soooo good luck!",
