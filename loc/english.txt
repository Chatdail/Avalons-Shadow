	"heist_hwu_brief":"We heard news of Avalon experimenting with new tech in one of their secret facilities that could be a serious blow to our stock prices. We don't know what this new tech is, and the exact whereabouts of this facility, but we have managed to narrow it down to one of their warehouses. Getting in will be tricky, but we're positive that a neighbouring house has some kind of hidden connection to it we could exploit. \nSo to recap: we don't know what the tech is, where it is, or how to get there. Good luck!",
