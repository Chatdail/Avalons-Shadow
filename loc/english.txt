	"heist_hwu_brief":"We got information of Avalon posessing data somewhere in one of their warehouses that would be a serious blow to us. They like to keep their eyes on things, so they picked a safehouse nearby and we know they use it to get inside without rasing suspicion. We need you to infiltrate the safehouse, find a way inside the warehouse and find where they keep the data. Now I would prefer if you did this quiet, but I do like violence so if the opportunity arises I'm fine with that too.\nSo to recap: we don't know what the data is, where it is, or how to get there. Good luck!",
