	"heist_hwu_brief":"So we've recieved information Avalon has data that could be potentially dangerous to our business stored in a warehouse somewhere. I'm not entirely sure where this information is, but I do know they have a safehouse located outside the compound. Infiltrate the safehouse and get me access to their network, we can't afford for this intel to leak. \nNow I'd prefer if you did this quiet, no strings attached and all that. But I'm a sucker for violence, so if you do have to make a mess of things at least make it entertaining. \n\nAgain, we're not sure what information they have, where it's at, or how to access it... so good luck!",
